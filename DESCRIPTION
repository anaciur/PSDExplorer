Description: PSDExplorer is an R package that integrates R and Python for 
    layer-based exploration of protein–protein interaction networks within 
    the postsynaptic density (PSD). It enables users to visualize and expand 
    multi-layer networks derived from scaffold protein interactions, identify 
    hub proteins, perform GO enrichment, and detect functional clusters.
    The package bridges computational network analysis with synaptic biology 
    using a reproducible, modular design.
