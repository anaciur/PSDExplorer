# PSDExplorer

## Description

**PSDExplorer** is an R package for **layer-based exploration** of protein–protein interaction networks within the **postsynaptic density (PSD)** — a key region involved in synaptic signaling and plasticity.

This package extends a Python engine that iteratively builds and visualizes PSD interaction networks using **PyVis**, allowing users to explore multi-layer connectivity starting from seed scaffold proteins.  
The R interface integrates this engine into a reproducible workflow and provides tools for cluster detection, GO enrichment, and network summary statistics.

### Uniqueness
Current bioinformatics workflows rarely model the PSD as a **layer-expanding system**.  
**PSDExplorer** introduces an iterative expansion algorithm that captures hierarchical organization — expanding the network by adding proteins that share a user-defined number of interactions with the previous layer.  
This framework helps uncover both structural and functional modules in the PSD.

**Developed and tested on:**
